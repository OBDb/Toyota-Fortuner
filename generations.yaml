    description: "The first-generation Toyota Fortuner was developed as a mid-size SUV based on the Hilux pickup truck platform, targeting emerging markets across Asia, the Middle East, South America, and Australia (where it was initially known as the HiLux SW4). Featuring traditional body-on-frame construction with a design that emphasized ruggedness and utility, the Fortuner offered three rows of seating for up to seven passengers and genuine off-road capability, distinguishing it from the more car-like crossovers that were becoming increasingly common. Powertrain options varied by market but typically included a range of diesel and gasoline engines, with the most common being 2.5-liter and 3.0-liter turbo-diesel four-cylinders, and a 2.7-liter gasoline option, paired with manual or automatic transmissions. All variants featured selectable four-wheel drive with a low-range transfer case for off-road use. The interior prioritized durability and practicality over luxury, though higher trim levels offered features like leather seating, climate control, and upgraded audio systems. A significant facelift in 2011 brought updated styling with a more aggressive front end, interior refinements, and mechanical improvements. The first-generation Fortuner established itself as a popular choice in markets where its combination of rugged reliability, off-road capability, and seven-seat practicality were highly valued, particularly for family transportation in regions with challenging road conditions or where outdoor recreation was popular."

    description: "The second-generation Toyota Fortuner maintains its position as a rugged, body-on-frame SUV derived from the Hilux pickup platform, but with significantly improved refinement, styling, and features to meet increasing consumer expectations in its target markets. Exterior design evolved to present a more modern, sophisticated appearance with sharp character lines, distinctive chrome detailing, and LED lighting elements while maintaining the practical proportions and elevated stance of its predecessor. Engine options continue to vary by market but generally include a range of improved diesel and gasoline options, with the 2.8-liter GD-series turbo-diesel becoming the mainstay in many regions, offering enhanced power, efficiency, and refinement compared to previous generations. Transmission options include six-speed manual and automatic, with selectable four-wheel drive featuring a two-speed transfer case. The interior represents a substantial upgrade with a more car-like dashboard design, improved materials, and enhanced technology including touchscreen infotainment systems with smartphone connectivity, while maintaining seating for seven across three rows. Safety features expanded significantly with the introduction of Toyota Safety Sense on higher trim levels in some markets, including pre-collision warning, lane departure alert, and dynamic radar cruise control. Off-road capability remains impressive with features like downhill assist control, active traction control, and a rear differential lock on some variants, while on-road comfort and handling improved through revised suspension tuning. A facelift in 2020 brought styling updates, increased power for the 2.8-liter diesel engine (now producing up to 204 horsepower and 500 Nm of torque), and additional technology features. The second-generation Fortuner continues to serve as Toyota's primary offering in the mid-size, body-on-frame SUV segment in markets across Asia, Australia, the Middle East, South America, and parts of Africa, offering a balance of durability, capability, and increased refinement for consumers in regions where its rugged characteristics remain highly valued."
